# 5G-security-issues
When it comes to internet security things can get very complicated very quickly. The security measures currently in place from many popular internet providers and other sources spent years testing and changing security systems to make sure that there were as few weaknesses as possible. With that being said not all internet is the same, and 5G is still quite new and therefore quite untested. 5G is far more complex than its predecessors meaning that many more potential vulnerabilities to be found and exploited.

Back on April 3rd 2021 a youtuber that goes by the name Seytonic made a video on this very topic. I highly recommend you watch his video, but for a brief summary he stated that due to 5G’s complexity there were 3 major vulnerabilities. 

#1: Unauthorised Access
#2: DoSing 5G
#3: Legacy Technology

    All of these vulnerabilities are present primarily due to 5G’s complexity and our general lack of tested security features in place for it. In time these vulnerabilities are likely to be better secured but that is not where we currently are. Seytonic concludes his video by stating that he does not mean that we should try and put an end to 5G as a whole. His goal was just to make people unaware that 5G is still an unrest technology and there are many flaws that we are going to have to work out before it can truly replace 4G.
