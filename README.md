# 5G-security-issues
When it comes to internet security things can get very complicated very quickly. The security measures currently in place from many popular internet providers and other sources have spent years testing and adapting the security systems to make sure that there were as few weaknesses as possible. With that being said not all internet is the same, and 5G is still quite new and therefore quite untested. 5G is far more complex than its predecessors meaning that many more potential vulnerabilities to be found and exploited.

Back on April 3rd 2021 a youtuber that goes by the name [Seytonic](https://www.youtube.com/c/Seytonic/featured) made a video on this very topic. I highly recommend you watch his video, but for a brief summary he stated that due to 5G’s complexity there were 3 major vulnerabilities. 

#1: Unauthorised Access                                                                     
#2: DoSing 5G                                                                                 
#3: Legacy Technology 

All of these vulnerabilities are present primarily due to 5G’s complexity and our general lack of tested security features in place for it. In time these vulnerabilities are likely to be better secured but that is not where we currently are. Seytonic concludes his video by stating that he does not mean that we should try and put an end to 5G as a whole. His goal was just to make people unaware that 5G is still an unrest technology and there are many flaws that we are going to have to work out before it can truly replace 4G. 

# U.S. Intelligence Agencies Get Involved
You might think that this was the end of the story but on May 11th 2021 NSA, ODNI and CISA released an analysis paper on 5G and tackled the issue of security with this technology.

Their paper includes a long list of known and also potential threats to 5G. Experts that comprise the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) are seeking out ways to explore potential threats and attempt to help prioritize which threats should be addressed first. 

# Conclusion
Since the release of this paper there have been no credible updates to how this process of vulnerability assessment for 5G is going, but one thing for sure: if 5G is ever going to be a viable option for a multitude of platforms longterm it must resolve these blaring security issues.
